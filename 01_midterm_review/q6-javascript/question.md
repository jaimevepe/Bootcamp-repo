Write a Javascript loop that will iterate from 40 to 60, both included, and log, if the number is ...

... odd or even.

Hint: think about using the modulus operator in Javascript.

for (let i = 40; i <= 60: i++) {
    if (i===0){
        console.log(i + " is even");
    }
    else if(i % 2===0){
        console.log(i + " is even");
    }
    else {
        console.log(i + " is odd");
    }
}
