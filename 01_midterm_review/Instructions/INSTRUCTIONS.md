##### Saturday, March 14th, 2020

</center>

# INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Git clone this `Students_Jan_2020_Reviews` folder to your computer, within Documents or Desktop folder.

1. Copy this `01_midterm_review` folder over to your ACCSoftwareBootcamp group's personal repository, so you may edit the contents there and commit/push them for grading.  

    For example, get the questions from

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Jan_2020_Reviews/01_Midterm_Review`

    And push your answers to

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE/01_Midterm_Review`

    
1. There's a folder for each question.  Please paste your answers within the respective folder, in the `question.md` file or new files named something like `answer.md` or `answer.js`.  

1. This review is in 3 parts

    1. **Multiple choice questions**. 20% of the credit.

    2. **Small questions**.  50% of the credit.

    3. **Practical portion**.  30% of the credit.


1. This review is open book.  You may use all references available to you to answer the questions. You may ask instructors/mentors to point you in the right direction, if you are stuck. Think of this as a typical work environment, where you may ask a mentor to show you the way, but not do the work for you. Do not ask another student.

1. If a code snippet on the review has a bug, please feel free to fix it and then answer.

1. To make sure you have enough time for all short questions, return to the difficult ones later. They are not numbered in any particular order.

1. Please `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your answers to your private ACCSoftwareBootcamp repository only. If you do not complete the material, you would be given extra time. You would get graded on both sets of answers, the on-time answers and the late answers. Your final grade would depend on both answers. The late answers would attract a small penalty. Hence, please do complete as much as you can and commit/push your answers on time.


### TIME AVAILABLE

1. This review can be completed within 4 hours. You have until 5 pm on the review day to complete, and git push your responses. If you are not done by 5 pm, please push your incomplete responses. Then you may go and finish the answers anytime before Monday.


### INTEGRITY: 

Remember this review is a test of how well prepared you are. You need a honest answer. Try to satisfy the spirit of the review. While some of the questions may appear difficult, they CAN be answered with some amount of research. It is more important to learn from this experience, than bypass it. As such, let us set some ground rules

- No sharing of direct or indirect answers.
- Absolutely no sharing of answer code.
- No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too ;-).
- Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#midterm** such that all students have access to the same clarification. 


### EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. Evidence of understanding of the underlying concepts related to the question. Can you answer the "why?"?  Your answer should be within a sentence or two.  Long answers are not needed as they take away precious time. (25% weightage)

1. How complete is your answer and/or your code.  Code is complete if it can handle all possible inputs, e.g. user error (25% weightage).

1. Have you annotated your code with comments so it is reasonably understandable? Have you indented your code appropriately so an instructor can follow your answer code? Very long comments are not needed. The comments should be sufficient for an experienced developer to follow your solution. (25% weightage)

1. Does your code work, where applicable? (25% weightage).


### PASSING CRITERIA & SCORING STRATEGIES

1. 70% of overall score is needed for overall success. 

1. You may take upto 4 hours on the review day to complete the review. Please remember to commit/push your answers before the 4 hours are up. You may take additional time after that to complete your answers. However, remember to commit/push your answers before the 4 hour mark.

1. Credit is given for partially complete or partly correct answers as well. Hence do not skip questions.

1. Do attempt the practical portion and push it, even if it doesn't work. Even non-working practical portion may attract enough credit to put you over the 70% mark.
