1. What are some techniques you may use to make your CSS more efficient? (Please do not talk about images here). (50%)

- One i would say is to be more DRY(dont repeat yourself), avoid repetition when styling more then one item all togethere.
Another would be the naming on your classes, class name could describe in short what the element does and Which element you are referring to. whenever you go back to the CSS file and look at the selectors names, should be able to quickly identify what class is for specific alement.
Also specificity which for me is sounds easy but really is a bit more difficult when you are styling mutiple items in one selector block.

- I would say to resize huge images if its an image heavy site. Type of image file also helps with the rendering of an image. JPG uses less memmory so it renders much quicker rather then PNG files.
