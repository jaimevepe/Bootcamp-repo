### Feedback:

Your project works almost perfectly. That is awesome.
However, here's the cool critique:

- no comments.  big deal!! how do i know that you understood
  the concepts?  - 4 points

- for perfection, I'd have liked to see implementation of 
  pagination.  That is what if the user wanted to see more
  gifs. - 1 point

- for more perfection, I'd also not like to see console.log
  messages in the terminal. Your app would typically run on
  a server, and these messages would, over time fill up the
  disk space with the server.log's that would be generated.

- for really perfect solution, I'd also see some styling on
  the results page.  And some messages on the home page that
  tell the user how to use this app.  - no points deducted.
