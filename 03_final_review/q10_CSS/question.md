## Question: 

1. Why can I not set the margin-top on the span with the id "txt" ? 

-Spans are inline block and cant take margins vertically. They also cant take hegith and width.

1. Why can I not set the margin-top on the img with the id "pic" in the head section?

-Because the inline styling is overwriting the head section styling.
