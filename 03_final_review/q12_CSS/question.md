The following questions have equal weightage. The 2nd question has a choice. Each answer MUST be completed within 150 words:

1. Describe pseudo-elements and discuss what are they used for?

-Pseudo-elements are used to add styling to specific parts of an element. Lets say you only want one letter of the wors DOG, lets say the D, to be the color red. Youll use pseudo styling to target the D and style only the D to the color red.
You can use before and after pseudo to add some CSS before or after an element is called.

2. What does * { box-sizing: border-box; } do? What are its advantages?
or
2. What’s the difference between inline and inline-block?

-inline cant take height or width vertically, if you try, it wont be respected.
inline-block can take height and width styling, and you can nest inline-block elements with in eachother. 
You can nest an inline-block elelemtn with-in an inline element since the inline element can't be styled.
Divs are block and spans are inline, you can place a span inside a div, but a div inside a span will not be respected.

3. What’s the difference between a relative, fixed, absolute and statically positioned element?

-Relative - the element is positioned relative to its normal position. Fixed - the element is positioned related to the browser window. A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located. Absolute - is the element positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent. Elements with no parents, will just move down along with the page.  Static - this is the default value, all elements are in order as they appear in the document. They are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties. 

4. What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?

- display:none; or visibility: hidden; this will remove text from the flow of the page.
width: 0px, height:0px; will also remove text from the the flow of the page and will be ignored by the readers.
text-indent: -10000px; will move text or content to the left 10000 pixels, moving it out of the screen.
